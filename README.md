# OWASP Product Security Capability Framework (PSCF)

The OWASP Product Security Capability Framework (PSCF) is a comprehensive guide designed to frame and enhance the security of software products. By leveraging a structured approach to identify, implement, and manage security capabilities, the PSCF aims to improve product security and ensure compliance with regulatory and industry standards.

## Introduction

Security is a critical aspect of software product quality. The OWASP PSCF provides a meta-analysis across various regulatory frameworks and industry standards to outline best practices in product security. This framework is intended for organizations looking to elevate their security posture through a systematic and evidence-based approach.

## Framework Core Concepts

- **Security Requirements, Not Security Opinions**: The PSCF is built on the foundation of security requirements derived from a thorough analysis of regulatory frameworks and industry standards, avoiding subjective opinions.
- **Capabilities Drive Secure Product**: By focusing on fundamental security capabilities, the PSCF ensures that product delivery meets the highest security standards.
- **Understanding, Information, & Opportunity**: Emphasizes the importance of knowledge and awareness in implementing security measures effectively.
- **Accountability & Responsibility**: Assigns clear accountability and responsibilities within the organization to maintain a high level of security.

## Framework Capability Areas

1. **Risk Management**: Identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks to enhance product security and support business objectives.
2. **Secure Product Management**: Ensures that product management practices incorporate security considerations from the outset.
3. **Secure Product Implementation**: Guides the implementation phase to integrate security measures seamlessly.
4. **Secure Build & Deployment**: Focuses on secure methodologies for building and deploying software products.
5. **Quality Control**: Establishes quality control measures to maintain security standards throughout the product lifecycle.
6. **Operational Visibility**: Enhances visibility into operations to detect and respond to security threats promptly.

## Adopting the Framework

Implementing the PSCF in your organization involves:

1. **Understanding Your Compliance Obligations**: Identify both external and internal compliance obligations relevant to your organization.
2. **Evaluating Your Security Capabilities**: Assess your current security capabilities against the PSCF to identify areas for improvement.
3. **Continuous Capability Improvement**: Implement a process for ongoing evaluation and enhancement of security capabilities.
